_A modern CLI and SDK for the Philips Hue API written in Kotlin._

## CLI

Shade's CLI tools can be used to connect, discover and control lights
on your Hue Bridge.

```shell
$ shade-cli connect
Connecting to bridge at 192.168.1.100
Waiting to connect. Press the button on your Hue Device now.
Success ðŸŽ‰

$ shade lights:list
1:
  name: Renee's Office
  uuid: 00:19:28:37:00:a1:b9:f2-0b
  type: Extended color light
  firmware: 5.127.1.26581
2:
  name: Kitchen
  uuid: 00:91:82:73:00:b9:c3:7a-0b
  type: Extended color light
  firmware: 5.127.1.26581

$ shade lights:control 1 --on --brightness 50
```

## Kotlin SDK

Shede's Kotlin SDK uses Kotlin Coroutines and a modern API to allow
your JVM or Android app to discover and control lights.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    runBlocking {
        println("Searching for Hue Bridges")
        val shade = Shade()
        val devices = shade.discovery.getDevices()
        shade.setBaseUrl(devices.first().url)

        println("Press the connect button on the hue bridge")
        shade.auth.awaitToken()

        println("Turning all the lights on!")
        shade.groups.setState(
            GROUP_ALL,
            GroupStateModification(
                on = on
            )
        )
    }
}
```
