# Shade ðŸ•¶
Shade is an SDK for the Philips Hue API written for Kotlin.

## Experimental!!
This project is much too new to be relied on.
Check back soon. 
I swear I'll write Docs when it's ready. ðŸ˜Ž
(Cause Philips sure as hell didn't)

### Status

Hue has several classes of endpoints. The goal is for this SDK to 
provide access to all of them.

 - [x] Authentication
 - [x] Lights API
 - [ ] Groups API
 - [ ] Schedules API
 - [ ] Scenes API
 - [ ] Sensors API
 - [ ] Rules API
 - [ ] Configuration API
 - [ ] Info API
 - [ ] Resource Links API
 - [ ] Capabilities API

## Usage (Android)

## Usage (JVM)

### Installation

If you havenâ€™t already, add JitPack to your gradle repositories in 
your `build.gradle` file:

    repositories {
        maven {
            url "https://jitpack.io"
        }
    }
    
Next, add Shade as a dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

    compile "com.github.Inkapplications.Shade:shade:+" // Replace with exact version

### Initialize Shade

Connect Shade to your Hue Bridge by providing a config:

 - `baseUrl`: The URL of the Hue Hub you want to connect to
 - `appID`: A Unique ID for your application.

```kotlin
val config = ShadeConfig(baseUrl = "http://192.168.0.2/", appId = "shade#shade")
val shade = Shade(config)
```

### Authenticate with Hue

To authenticate with your hue system call the `awaitToken()` method:

```kotlin
suspend fun connect() {
    println("Waiting for token. Press Button on Hue Bridge")
    shade.auth.awaitToken()
    println("Authenticated Successfully!")
}
```

### Control Lights

```kotlin
suspend fun turnOffAll() {
    shade.lights.getLights().forEach { (id, light) ->
        println("Turning off Light ID: $id, Name: ${light.name}")
        shade.lights.setLightState(id, LightStateModification(on = false))
    }
}
```
