# Shade ðŸ•¶
Shade is an SDK for the Philips Hue API written for Kotlin.

## Project Status

This project is relatively new, and the Hue API isn't well documented.
Shade is currently functional, but API's may change as more is learned
about the Hue API.

Hue has several classes of endpoints. The goal is for this SDK to
provide access to all of them.

 - [x] Authentication
 - [x] Lights API
 - [x] Groups API
 - [x] Schedules API
 - [ ] Scenes API
 - [ ] Sensors API
 - [ ] Rules API
 - [ ] Configuration API
 - [ ] Info API
 - [ ] Resource Links API
 - [ ] Capabilities API

### Installation

If you havenâ€™t already, add JitPack to your gradle repositories in 
your `build.gradle` file:

    repositories {
        maven {
            url "https://jitpack.io"
        }
    }
    
Next, add Shade as a dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

    compile "com.github.Inkapplications.Shade:shade:+" // Replace with exact version

### Initialize Shade

Connect Shade to your Hue Bridge by providing a config:

 - `baseUrl`: The URL of the Hue Hub you want to connect to
 - `appID`: A Unique ID for your application.

```kotlin
val config = ShadeConfig(baseUrl = "http://192.168.0.2/", appId = "shade#shade")
val shade = Shade(config)
```

### Authenticate with Hue

To authenticate with your hue system call the `awaitToken()` method:

```kotlin
suspend fun connect() {
    println("Waiting for token. Press Button on Hue Bridge")
    shade.auth.awaitToken()
    println("Authenticated Successfully!")
}
```

### Control Lights

```kotlin
suspend fun turnOffAll() {
    shade.lights.getLights().forEach { (id, light) ->
        println("Turning off Light ID: $id, Name: ${light.name}")
        shade.lights.setLightState(id, LightStateModification(on = false))
    }
}
```

### Groups

Groups can be accessed through Shade's `.groups` service:

```kotlin
shade.groups.getGroups()
    .also { println("Found ${it.size} Light Groups") }
    .forEach { (id, group) -> println("    Group ID: $id, Name: ${group.name}") }

shade.groups.setState("10", GroupStateModification(
    on = true,
    colorTemperature = 200,
    brightness = 100
))
```
